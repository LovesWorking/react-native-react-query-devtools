Buoy is a floating dev menu that ships inside your React Native app — every request, state change, render, and frame, live on the phone, on your desktop, and in Claude or Cursor.

**Every tool is free. Pro unlocks production builds, MCP & unlimited capture.**

**🎯 Now in beta: [Buoy for Flutter](https://github.com/Buoy-gg/Buoy-Flutter)** — `flutter pub add buoy`, wrap your app in one `BuoyDevTools` widget, and get the full suite: network, storage, console, env, routes, images, impersonate, image overlay, an events timeline, a Riverpod inspector, and a live perf HUD — all on the same desktop dashboard and MCP server. [Details →](https://buoy.gg/flutter)

![Buoy demo — the floating dev menu in action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a732d6a3-9963-49e3-b0f1-0d974a0a74d7)

</div>

- **One component, zero config** — drop in `<FloatingDevTools />` once; install any tool package and it appears in the menu on its own
- **24 tools, every environment** — network, state, storage, renders, performance and more, in dev, staging, *and* production builds
- **Your agent can drive it** — Claude or Cursor reads live state, taps real buttons, and benchmarks on a physical device over MCP

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
npm install @buoy-gg/core
```

```tsx
import { FloatingDevTools } from "@buoy-gg/core";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Your app */}
      <FloatingDevTools />
    </>
  );
}
```

That's the whole setup. A floating dev menu appears inside your app.

> [!NOTE]
> Install any tool package and it auto-appears in the menu. Most tools need zero config — a few take one line, like passing `zustandStores` or calling `watchAtoms()`. Every tool works without a key, at reduced capture. A **free key** (`npx buoy login`, no card) restores the full free tier; [Pro](https://buoy.gg/pricing) unlocks production builds, the MCP server, Ask Buoy, and unlimited capture.

---

## 🛟 One live session. Four ways in.

Every tool runs inside your app's process. The phone, the desktop, your agent and the in-app chat all see the same session, live.

- **📱 On the phone** — tap the floating menu. Works on any device, no cable, no desktop app, no Metro.
- **🖥️ On your desktop** — [Buoy Desktop](https://github.com/Buoy-gg/Buoy-Desktop) mirrors the on-device tools to full-screen panels on macOS, Windows & Linux, with a live UI/JS FPS · CPU · memory HUD and remote control of the device.
- **🤖 Through your agent** — the [Buoy MCP server](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/mcp) gives Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP editor structured tool calls into the running app.
- **💬 In plain English** — [Ask Buoy](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/tools/ask-buoy) *(beta)* puts an AI chat inside the app that drives the same tools for QA, support and product. Your model endpoint, your key; nothing goes through Buoy.

## 🤖 Your agent gets hands

```bash
npx -y @buoy-gg/mcp@latest init
```

One command wires the Buoy MCP server into Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code — non-destructively.

**Your agent presses real UI handlers in JS, reads live app state, and benchmarks on a physical device — no screenshots, no pixel coordinates, no synthesized touches.**

- **Read the runtime** — `get_events` and `get_console` stream what the app is actually doing, in token-friendly summaries
- **Drive the UI** — `describe_screen` walks the live React tree into an accessibility-style element list with tap points; `tap_element` presses the real handler in JS. Works on physical devices.
- **Change state** — `get_redux_state` / `redux_dispatch`, `get_zustand_state`, `get_jotai_state`, `get_react_query` / `react_query_action`, `get_storage` / `storage_action`, `get_routes` / `navigate`
- **Measure** — `run_benchmark_batch` runs Bench cases on a real device and returns a ranked comparison; `screenshot_component` returns a tight crop of any component by testID (iOS Simulator); `list_devices` picks the target

`init` also installs the **buoy-optimize** skill: a wizard that benchmarks variants on the real device, applies the winner, and repeats until metrics plateau. One real run took a Skia LED display from 28 stuttering lights to over 12,000 — no lag.

## Why Buoy?

Flipper is deprecated. What's left is shaking the device for a dev menu, `console.log` archaeology over a cable, and desktop debuggers that stop working the moment you ship a staging or production build. And when an AI agent works on your app, it's debugging blind — it can edit the code but can't see what the running app is doing.

Buoy inverts the model: the tools live in the app itself, so they go wherever the app goes — the simulator, a tester's phone, production. A tiny localhost broker mirrors the same session to your desktop and your agent.

|                              | Buoy | Flipper | Reactotron | RN Debugger |
| ---------------------------- | :--: | :-----: | :--------: | :---------: |
| On-device, no desktop app required | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Works in production builds   | ✅   | ❌      | ❌         | ❌          |
| AI agent control (MCP)       | ✅   | ❌      | ❌         | ❌          |
| QA & support can use it      | ✅   | ❌      | ❌         | ❌          |
| Zero config setup            | ✅   | ❌      | ❌         | ❌          |

## Safe in production

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everything runs in your app's process. The broker that mirrors to desktop and MCP binds to localhost only — nothing ever leaves your machine. You decide who sees the tools:

```tsx
<>
  {/* Your app */}
  {isInternalUser && <FloatingDevTools />}
</>
```

That one line is the whole production story: internal builds and flagged users get the full toolkit; everyone else gets nothing.

Want the session without any on-device UI at all — field builds, kiosk devices, apps handed to non-developers? Headless mode keeps every tool syncing to Buoy Desktop and MCP while rendering nothing on the device:

```tsx
<FloatingDevTools headless />
```

## 💳 Every tool is free. A free key unlocks the rest.

Every tool is **free**, forever, on every tier — the only thing that changes is
how much history each one keeps.

| | How to get it | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No key** | nothing to do | Every tool, with a short capture window — enough to see what each one does. |
| **Free** | `npx buoy login` — no card, ~30 seconds | The full free tier: real history across every tool, and Pro free every weekend. |
| **Pro** | [buoy.gg/pricing](https://buoy.gg/pricing) | Everything: production builds, the MCP server, Ask Buoy, unlimited capture. |

Paid plans unlock production builds, the MCP server, Ask Buoy, and unlimited capture — **Solo is $9/month ($89/year) for individuals**, and **Business is $45/seat/month** for companies, with priority support and volume pricing. Both come with a 14-day trial.

Grab your key — free or paid, same command:

```bash
npx buoy login
```

Run it from a project that already has `@buoy-gg/core` installed — npx resolves
the command from your own `node_modules`. If it tries to download something
instead, name the package: `npx --package=@buoy-gg/core buoy login`.

It signs you in, writes the key to `.env.local`, and gitignores it. Then:

```tsx
Buoy.init({ licenseKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BUOY_KEY });
```

Or pass it straight in: `<FloatingDevTools licenseKey="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />`

**Weekend Pass:** every Saturday and Sunday, every Pro feature inside the tools unlocks free for anyone with a key — including a free one. Not a promo — it's built into the product. Run `npx buoy login`, try it for real, decide on Monday.
