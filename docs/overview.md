description: "Meet React Buoy, the in-app devtools platform for React Native — debug network, state, storage, and performance from your phone, desktop, or AI agent."
---

Buoy is a complete devtools platform for React Native. It turns **hours into seconds** for developers, QA, and product teams on tasks like regression testing, bug reproduction, performance work, and environment validation.

**One devtools engine, four ways to reach your running app:**

- **On your phone** — a zero-config floating menu inside your app, in dev, staging, and production.
- **On your desktop** — Buoy Desktop, a free dashboard for macOS, Windows & Linux that mirrors your tools with a live performance HUD.
- **Through your AI** — the [MCP server](./mcp) lets Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP editor inspect and control your live app (Pro).
- **In plain English, inside the app** — [Ask Buoy](./tools/ask-buoy), a chat that drives every tool for the people on your team who don't read code (Pro, beta). Your model endpoint, not ours.

Install once. Reach every tool from wherever you work.

## Who It's For

<!-- ::start:Audience-Grid -->

<!-- ::start:Audience title="Developers" tagline="Stop guessing. See exactly what's happening." -->
- **Storage event history** — Watch data changes in real-time. Step forward and backward through events.
- **Network inspector** — Every request, response, header, and error. No more console.log debugging.
- **Reproduce anything** — Open the tools, see the exact state, and reproduce bugs locally in seconds.

*"Before: Bug report → Ask for details → Add console.logs → Rebuild → Try to reproduce → Guess at state → Repeat"*

*"After: Bug report → Open Buoy → See exact state → Fix"*
<!-- ::end:Audience -->

<!-- ::start:Audience title="QA" tagline="Test things that were previously untestable." -->
- **Trigger any state** — Loading states, error states, empty states, edge cases. Now you can test them all.
- **Edit data live** — Change values in seconds. No more waiting for database changes.
- **Validate everything** — Storage validators flag missing keys, wrong types, and invalid values instantly.
- **Real regression testing** — Test the app AND the API. Stale data, race conditions, permission edge cases.

*"Before: Need edge case → Ask dev to update DB → Wait 30+ min → Test → Need another change → Wait again → Repeat"*

*"After: Need edge case → Edit value in Buoy → Test → Edit again → Test again → Done in seconds"*
<!-- ::end:Audience -->

<!-- ::start:Audience title="Customer Support" tagline="See exactly what your users see." -->
- **Impersonation tools** — Sync as a user and see their exact state. No more "works on my machine."
- **Copy debug data** — Grab storage state, network logs, and environment info for bug reports.
- **Instant answers** — Is the data wrong or is it a refresh issue? Check storage. Is the API failing? Check network.

*"Before: Customer reports issue → Ask for screenshots → Ask for more info → Escalate to dev → Dev can't reproduce → Back and forth for days"*

*"After: Customer reports issue → Impersonate user → See exact state → Copy debug data → Dev reproduces instantly"*
<!-- ::end:Audience -->

<!-- ::start:Audience title="Product & Everyone Else" tagline="Remove the friction that slows everyone down." -->
- **Feature flags in seconds** — No more asking someone to enable a feature on your account.
- **Skip the login dance** — Need to test as admin? As a new user? As a banned user? Just set it.
- **Jump to any route** — Go directly to the screen you need. Validate auth checks and permissions.

*"Before: Need feature flag → Slack dev → Wait → Need admin role → Slack another dev → Wait → Log out → Log in → Navigate to screen"*

*"After: Open Buoy → Toggle flag → Set role → Jump to route → Done"*

This isn't a "nice to have." It's the difference between hours of debugging and coordination versus seconds. The time savings compound across your entire team.

## Why Buoy

- **Zero config** — Install a package, it appears in the menu. No wiring.
- **Four ways in** — The same tools on your phone, on your desktop, through your AI agent, and in the app's own chat.
- **Works everywhere** — Dev, staging, production. Same tools for everyone.
- **Modular** — Only install what you need. Each tool is a separate package.
- **Team-friendly** — Onboard new devs in minutes with consistent debugging.

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { FloatingDevTools } from "@buoy-gg/core";

export default function App() {
  return (

      <FloatingDevTools licenseKey="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
    </>
  );
}
```
