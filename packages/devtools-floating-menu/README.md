**Devtools that live in your app. And answer to your agent.**

Buoy is a floating dev menu that ships inside your React Native app. Every request, state change, render, and frame — live on the phone, on your desktop, and in Claude or Cursor. Drop in one component, install the tools you want, and they appear in the menu on their own.

![Buoy demo — the floating dev menu in action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a732d6a3-9963-49e3-b0f1-0d974a0a74d7)

## Install

```bash
npm install @buoy-gg/core
```

## Quick start

```tsx
import { FloatingDevTools } from "@buoy-gg/core";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Your app */}
      <FloatingDevTools />
    </>
  );
}
```

That's the whole setup — a floating dev menu appears inside your app. Install any tool package and it auto-appears in the menu; most need zero config, a few take one line (like passing `zustandStores` or calling `watchAtoms()`). Add a `licenseKey` prop to unlock [Pro](https://buoy.gg/pricing): production builds, the MCP server, Ask Buoy, and unlimited capture.

Two more ship for React Native TV — [TV Remote](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/tools/tv-remote) and [Focus Inspector](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/tools/focus-inspector) — and [Camera](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/tools/camera) gives the iOS Simulator a working camera with no app integration at all.

## Four surfaces, one live session

Every tool runs inside your app's process. The phone, the desktop, your agent and the in-app chat all see the same session, live.

- **On the phone** — tap the floating menu. Works on any device, no cable, no desktop app, no Metro.
- **On your desktop** — [Buoy Desktop](https://github.com/Buoy-gg/Buoy-Desktop) (free) mirrors the tools to full-screen panels on macOS, Windows & Linux, with a live FPS / CPU / memory HUD and remote control of the device. Devices connect automatically — physical phones included, no URLs to configure.
- **Through your agent** — the [Buoy MCP server](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/mcp) gives Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP editor structured tool calls into the running app: read live state, tap real buttons, run benchmarks on a physical device.
- **In plain English** — [Ask Buoy](https://buoy.gg/buoy/latest/docs/tools/ask-buoy) *(beta)* puts an AI chat inside the app that drives the same tools for QA, support and product. Your model endpoint, your key; nothing goes through Buoy.

## Free vs Pro

Every tool is **free** on every tier — only how much history each keeps changes. A free key (`npx buoy login`, no card) restores the full free tier.

**Pro** unlocks production builds, the MCP server, Ask Buoy, and unlimited capture. Activate with one prop:

```tsx
<FloatingDevTools licenseKey="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
```

**Weekend Pass:** every Saturday and Sunday, every Pro feature unlocks free for anyone holding a key — including a free one. Built into the product, not a promo. Details at [buoy.gg/pricing](https://buoy.gg/pricing).

## Safe in production

Everything runs in your app's process. The broker that mirrors the session to desktop and MCP binds to localhost only — nothing ever leaves your machine. You decide who sees the tools:

```tsx
{isInternalUser && <FloatingDevTools />}
```

That one line is the whole production story: internal builds and flagged users get the full toolkit; everyone else gets nothing.

Need the session with **no on-device UI at all** — field builds or devices handed to non-developers? Headless mode keeps every tool syncing to Buoy Desktop and MCP while rendering nothing on the device:

```tsx
<FloatingDevTools headless />
```
